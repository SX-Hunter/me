As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly interwoven into daily life, shaping education, healthcare, finance, and governance, it presents both opportunities and challenges. While AI tools can support learning, productivity, and innovation, they also introduce significant risks, including bias, misinformation, and ethical ambiguity.

Many people are unaware of the impact AI may already be having on their lives. As such, I am interested in exploring whether interactive fiction can be used as an instructional strategy to enhance long-term AI literacy. <em>LibraSense Scandal</em> is a fictional scenario rooted in real-life issues surrounding AI. Set in a library, this short story invites the audience to consider both the benefits and drawbacks of AI in that context. The narrative unfolds through multiple perspectives, including a librarian, a patron, and a developer, to explore how the parameters of a particular AI system may affect different individuals.
