Listening to what's going on in the States has my anxiety on high alert. Currently, the US has a list of "blacklisted" words that if you use on your grant proposal, you're getting turned down. The one that stuck with me was "pregnant person." Your research cannot include "pregnant persons."

That these issues are currently more blatant in the States, doesn't mean that Canada is without isses. While I was pregnant with my youngest, I participated in a study on pregnancy and disordered sleep. The lead researcher told me that her previous proposal had been declined because pregnant people are too small of a population sample for the research to be relevant.
