I’m a curious creative with a love for digital storytelling, thoughtful design, and community-driven work. I’m drawn to projects that invite play, spark dialogue, and make space for empathy.

Outside of design and learning, you’ll often find me experimenting with illustration, going on adventures with my kids, or dreaming up interactive narratives. I’m always looking for meaningful collaborations and new ways to bring ideas to life.

When not in front of the computer, I can be found with roller skates on my feet or enjoying Earl Grey ice cream.

Maker-Scholar Statement
======
My work sits at the intersection of learning, storytelling, and empathy. My passion for the digital arts stems from a belief that they can connect people and foster communities. Whether I’m designing interactive learning experiences, curating meaningful content, or crafting animations and illustrations, I approach making as both a critical and creative act.

My practice is informed by a background in art and design, library and information studies, and a deep commitment to accessibility, community, and care. I work across disciplines and platforms, blending theory with praxis.
